        Motion has been detected, very briefly describe what you see in this
        image from my driveway camera number 1. What do you think caused
        the motion alarm? If a person is present, describe them in detail. Don't
        describe stationary objects or buildings. Your message needs to be short
        enough to fit in a phone notification.
